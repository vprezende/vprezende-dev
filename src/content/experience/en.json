      "desc": "As the Lead Software Engineer for \"AgroSync\", I spearheaded the engineering and prototyping of a high-performance desktop solution designed to revolutionize Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forestry (ICLFS) planning. By implementing custom computational geometry algorithms and optimizing data processing, I architected a system projected to reduce technical planning time by ~60% compared to manual methods. I managed 100% of the research lifecycle — from high-fidelity UI/UX in Figma to technical validation using Clean Architecture in Flutter — delivering the scalable architecture and technological foundation aimed at maximizing agricultural productivity in the Rio de Janeiro region."
